The National chronicles is a fully responsive static news website developed as an Individual Assignment under the Full Stack Development program. The project is inspired by popular online news platforms such as The Hindu and Times of India and focuses on implementing a professional news-style layout using frontend web technologies. The website is designed to present news content in a structured, readable, and visually appealing manner while maintaining simplicity and ease of navigation.

This project is built using four HTML files with in-built (internal) CSS, without using any backend technologies or external CSS frameworks. The main goal of the project is to demonstrate practical knowledge of HTML and CSS, responsive design principles, and basic SEO-friendly coding practices.
